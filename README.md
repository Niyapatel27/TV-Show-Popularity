# TV-Show-Popularity
Developed a machine learning model using Random Forest to classify Indian TV shows into "High" or "Low" popularity based on ratings, sentiment scores, and metadata (e.g., number of episodes/seasons).

Built a content-based recommendation system using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to suggest similar shows based on storyline analysis.

Integrated a chatbot-style recommender that interprets user descriptions using NLP to suggest relevant TV shows dynamically.
